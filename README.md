DESC: Repository for my config files of i3
The config executes the following programs, it may not work without them:
- Microsoft Teams :(
- Discord
- Chromium
- Steam
- Alacritty

Put i3 and i3status into:
.config

picom.conf into:
/etc/xdg/picom.conf

Finally, optionally put the Pictures into your home folder, it will set a default wallpaper, you can change it but keep the name as wallpaper.jpg
